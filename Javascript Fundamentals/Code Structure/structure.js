// Statements are syntax constructs and commands which perform actions.
// Statements can be separated with a semicolon, but should be put on new lines.

// Put "use strict" in order to execute js in modern way. Must be used at the top of the code
"use strict"

alert("Hello"); alert("World")

// The code below is better, newline implies a semicolon
alert("Hello")
alert("World")
